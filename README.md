Taken from [lightdm-webkit2-theme-arch](https://gitlab.com/kenogo/lightdm-webkit2-theme-arch) to update it for JezerM's web-greeter.

This is a very minimal theme for lightdm's [web-greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/web-greeter) which allows multiple users and chooses a random wallpaper each time. The wallpapers are from [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/4gc2lw/some_arch_wallpapers_i_made/?st=ivzxvmxu&sh=727d2f4e), you can even create your own one [here](https://demon000.github.io/archwg)!

You can put your own wallpapers in either `/usr/share/web-greeter/themes/arch/wallpapers` or `/usr/share/backgrounds/lightdm`

You can also find this in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lightdm-web-greeter-theme-arch/).
